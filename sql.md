### Key Symbols Explanation:
- **Rectangles**: Represent processes or actions (e.g., initialization, detection, and alerting).
- **Diamonds**: Represent decision points (e.g., "IR Receiver Senses Infrared Radiation?" or "Gas Sensor Monitors Air for Harmful Gases?").
- **Arrows**: Indicate the flow of the process from one step to the next.

This diagram provides a clear representation of the systemâ€™s behavior. Let me know if you'd like an image-based version or additional refinements!
