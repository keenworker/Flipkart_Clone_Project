### Explanation:  
1. **Central Block**: Represents the system's overall behavior, with fire and gas detection circuits functioning independently.  
2. **Circuits**: The fire detection and gas detection circuits operate in parallel.  
3. **Sensors**: IR Receiver and Gas Sensor detect environmental changes and send signals downstream.  
4. **Processing & Alerts**: Signals are processed to activate respective buzzers and LED indicators for user alerts.  
5. **Power Source**: The entire system is powered by a single 3.7V battery.
